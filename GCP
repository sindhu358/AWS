### Regions
Specific geographical locations to host local resources
advantages:
High availability
low latency
Global footprint
Adhere to govt regulations


Google cloud has multiple zones
Each region has --> 3 zones
                      |
                  Each zone has
                  one or more discrete cluster
CLuster: distinct physical infrastructure that is housed in a data centre.


## Compute Engine

Generaly in corporate data centres, applications are delpoyed to physical servers.
Whereas in Cloud you deploy applications as by:
1. Renting the virtual servers
2. Virtual Machines - Virtual servers in GCP
3. Google Compute ENgine(GCE): Provisiona and Manage VM


## Ip Addresses - VM
Internal IP - Permanent Internal IP Addres which does not change during the lifetime of an instance.
External IP - It changes if we stop and restart it again 
Static IP - Permananent external IP adress that can be attached to a VM 


## Instance Template
creating an instance template
  machine type, image,labels,startup script and other properties
It is used to create VM instances and managed instance groups(group of vm)
   can create similar instances
cannot be updated
make a copy of an existing template and modify that - Creating a new one
